# Sunrise to Sunset Transition Shader

https://github.com/abbas-dhd/bos_sunrise_sunset/assets/68743779/96ffd6d0-7de3-4168-9dd6-09dfc8bf2a99


This is a simple GLSL fragment shader that creates a smooth transition between gradients representing sunrise and sunset as a challenge on **Book of Shaders**. The effect was inspired by JC Nesciâ€™s implementation.

You can preview and interact with the shader using this [link](https://glslsandbox.com/e#106172.1).

## How it Works

This shader uses a combination of smoothstep and mix functions to create color gradients and timing and sin/cos functions to simulate the transition between day and night. It smoothly interpolates between the colors to create a visually pleasing sunrise to sunset effect.
